You are building an app in React, and have written the following navigation link in your code:

<a href="/" className="nav-item">Contact Us!</a>

When the user clicks this link, the app will navigate to the ‘Contact Us!’ page.  
False
Correct
Well done. That’s right! Instead of navigating to the Contact Us page, a click on the anchor tag will refresh the page.
