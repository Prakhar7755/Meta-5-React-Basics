You are creating a page for your app consisting of two components:

Parent: displays different information based on whether or not user has logged in.

Child: contains an event handler that sends data to Parent when ‘Log in’ button is clicked.

In this scenario, would it be better to use a stateful or stateless parent component?

Stateful

Correct
That's right! The parent component needs to maintain either a 'logged in' or 'logged out' state in order to work as intended, so it should be stateful.
