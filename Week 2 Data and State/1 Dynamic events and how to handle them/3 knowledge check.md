False

True

Correct
That’s correct! In fact, you have to do it.

That’s correct! Contrary to plain JavaScript, you cannot invoke an event-handling function to handle an event such as the onClick. That’s one of the differences between JSX and plain JavaScript syntax.

    The try...catch syntax can be used in React in certain cases.

1 / 1 point

That’s right! You can handle event-handling errors using the try...catch syntax.

5.  Question 5
    Choose the valid example of an onclick event handler.

1 / 1 point

<button onclick={handleClick}>Click me</button>

<button onClick={handleClick}>Click me</button>

<button on-click=”handleClick”>Click me</button>

<button onClick={handleClick()}>Click me</button>

Correct
That’s correct. This code will handle click events on the button by invoking the handleClick function.
