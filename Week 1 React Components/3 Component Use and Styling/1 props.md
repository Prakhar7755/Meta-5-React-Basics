In React, functional components are reusable blocks of code that act like a JavaScript function and you can pass data from one component to another using props. Which of the following statements are true? Select all that apply. 
     


-   Props are passed using JSX syntax.

Correct
That's correct. It's helpful to think of props as arguments that components can accept and are passed using JSX.


-  Props are like a JavaScript object.

Correct
That's correct. Props are like a JavaScript object in that they can accept many data types including strings, integers, functions, arrays and objects.     


-   When two components communicate with each other, the component sending the props data is known as the parent and the one receiving the data is known as the child.   

Correct
That's correct. Data flow is one-directional which means that a parent component can send the same data to one or more child components, but it's not possible to communicate from the child components back to the parent component using props.
