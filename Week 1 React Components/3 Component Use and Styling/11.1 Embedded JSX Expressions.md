You would like to use JSX to display a user’s location on a webpage, and you have defined the following JavaScript variable: 

const location = Boston;  

Which of the following lines of code uses the correct syntax for embedding this variable in an HTML paragraph element?


const result = <p>{location}</p>;
Correct
That’s right! The JavaScript variable should be placed between the paragraph tags and enclosed in curly braces.
