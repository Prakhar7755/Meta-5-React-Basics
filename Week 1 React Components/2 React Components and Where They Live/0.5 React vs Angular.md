The choice between React and Angular for beginners can depend on a few factors. Here are some points to consider:

#   **React**:
- React is a JavaScript library for UI development, managed by Facebook and an open-source community of developers¹.
- It is used in both web and mobile development. However, for mobile development, it needs to be incorporated with Cordova¹.
- React is a framework for UI development, so apps written with React need additional libraries to be used. For instance, Redux, React Router, or Helmet optimize the processes of state management, routing, and interaction with the API¹.

#   **Angular**:
- Angular is an open-sourced JavaScript framework for web and mobile development. It is TypeScript-based and managed by Google’s Angular Team and the Angular developer community¹.
- Angular is suitable for both web and mobile development. In mobile development, however, a great share of work is done by Ionic¹.
- Angular is a full-fledged framework for software development, which usually does not require additional libraries¹.

The common consensus is that Angular has a steeper learning curve than React⁴. This implies that beginners might find it easier to learn React than Angular⁴. However, the choice of TypeScript, coupled with Angular’s more opinionated style, makes Angular more challenging for beginners to pick up than React⁵. But this longer runway pays dividends later for enterprise-scale web applications because Angular’s scalability typically overshadows React’s⁵.

In the end, the choice between React and Angular will depend on your specific needs, project requirements, and personal preference. Both are powerful tools with their own strengths and weaknesses¹².
